# Shopping-List
Javascript Exercise for ZTM Web Developer in 2022

Original exercise:

    Using the Shopping List files from the previous videos update the shopping list app
    to do the following:

    1. If you click on the list item, it toggles the .done  class on and off.

    2. Add buttons next to each list item to delete the item when clicked on its
    corresponding delete button.

    3. BONUS: When adding a new list item, it automatically adds the delete button
    next to it (hint: be sure to check if new items are clickable too!)

Added later:

    - The items and the title are editable
    - While editing, enter will cause the text to be edited (not a new line)
    - Focus is on the input field on page load, after creating an item or after editing an item
    - When an item is checked as done, it is moved to a second list underneath the active list
    - The input field is on the bottom of the active list
    - The delete button for each list item only appears when you hover over the list
    - Added CSS with Tailwind cdn
